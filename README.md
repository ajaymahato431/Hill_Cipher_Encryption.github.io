Please Read these points to know about this encryption system

It is a 3*3 hill cipher cryptography technique.
It is using the following 3*3 key matrix:
It supports 26 characters i.e. A to Z.
It changes [SPACE] by converting it into 'Z', so in decrypted text, replace 'Z' with [SPACE] to get exact plain text
It encrypts the plain text, 3 characters at once, so make sure your plaintext is multiple of 3; if not then add [SPACE] at last to make it multiple of 3.
